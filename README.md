# Freecodcamp-WorldCupDatabasee

World Cup Database Management Project: This project involves creating and managing a World Cup database using PostgreSQL.
The initial database setup is achieved using SQL scripts, and data is loaded using a Bash script. 
The first script parses CSV data to populate teams and games tables while ensuring data integrity. The second script performs insightful queries on the database, 
calculating goals, averages, and extracting specific information such as champions, winning teams, and more. This project showcases proficiency in PostgreSQL,
database design, data loading, and querying, enhancing skills in database administration and management
